# SENDING REQUEST WITH `fetch`

FOR START WE ARE GOING TO DEFINE ONE BUTTON, AND ONE CONTAINER, WHICH WE'LL DO IN ONE OF OUR HTML FILES

**WE ARE ALSO GOING TO LINK SCRIPT TAG WITH script**

```
code web_server/web_files/shiba.html
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Shiba</title>
</head>
<body>
  <nav>
    <a href="/">Home</a>
    <a href="/shiba">Shiba</a>
  </nav>
  <div>Hello Shiba</div>
  <!-- I ADDED THIS -->
  <section>
    <!-- A BUTTON -->
    <button rel="js-button">Get All Records</button>
    <!-- AND ONE DIV -->
    <div rel="js-cont"></div>
  </section>

  <!-- WE WILL ALSO LINK TO JAVASCRIPT FILE WE
  ARE GOING TO MAKE NEXT -->
  <script src="scripts/records.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

## LETS DEFINE JAVASCRIPT FILE I MENTIONED TO YOU

```
touch web_server/web_files/records.js
```

```js
(function(){
  
  // LEETS JUST PRINT HELLO WORLD TO TEST THINGS OUT
  
  console.log("hello records")


})()
```

BEFORE WE TRY THINGS OUT I WANT TO MAKE ONE package.json SCRIPT TO, BECAUSE I NEED SHORTER THING TO RUN, TO BE MORE CONVENIEN

```
code package.json
```

```json
"start": "rm -rf web_server/my.db && ts-node web_server/index.ts",

```

LETS RESTART EVERYTHING AND RUN THE SCRIPT WITH yarn

```
yarn start
```

**NOW LETS GO TO <http://localhost:8066/shiba> AND CHECK THE CONSOLE**
