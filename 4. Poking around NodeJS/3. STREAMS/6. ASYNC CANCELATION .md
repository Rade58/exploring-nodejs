# YOU CAN USE `caf` PACKAGE FOR CACELATION OF STREAMS

[caf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/caf)

IT USES GENERATORS

I LEARNED THEM SO LONG AGO AND DIDN'T HAVE ANY USE CASE FOR THEM PRETTY MUCH EVEN THEY ARE POWERFULL SO I DON'T WANT TO SPEND TIME ON THIS; MAYBE SOME NEXT TIME

PRETTY MUCH IF STREAM TAKES TOO LONG YOU CAN USE caf TO STOP THE STREAM

BUT, WHEN YOU WANT TO DO CANCELLATION, YOU WOULD USE `unpipe` METHOD

ALSO YOU WOULD DO `destroy` METHOD
