# SHEBANG

YOU CAN PUT A "SHEBANG" COMMENT AT THE TOP OF THE FILE; WHICH WILL TELL SHELL ENVIRONMENT, THAT WHEN IT STARTS TO EXECUTE IT KNOWS WHAT PROGRAMS TO HAND THAT EXECUTION TO 

SYNTAX LOOKS LIKE THIS: **`#! <path of the file to use for interpretation>`**

# EXECUTABLE

WE GOT OT SAY TO SCRIPT WHERE TO FIND NODE EXECUTABLE IN OUR SYSTEM

WE ARE DOING THIS BY ADDING SHEBANG WHERE WE SPECIFY THE PATH TO NOODEJS

```
touch _exercise/shell_scripts/foo.js
```

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
```

WITH THIS WE ARE TELLING: *"GO FIND NODE WHERE EVER IT IS ON THE SYSTEM AND USE NODE TO INTERPRET THE REST OF MY PROGRAM"*

# YOU SHOULD BE ALWAYS RUNNING CODE IN STRICT MODE

DON'T WORRY WHEN PUTTING SHEBNG ABOVE "use strict" BECAUSE WHEN OUR CODE GETS EUNNED IT IS GOING TO BE STRIPPED FROM THE FILEL SHEBANG WONT BE THERE ANYMORE

I AM TELLING YOU THIS BECAUSE NORMALLY WHEN YOU'RE USING STRICT MODE `"use strict"` NEEDS TO BE ON TOP OF THE FILE

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

"use strict"

```

# WE NEED TO CHANGE MODE OF THE FILE TO ALLOW HIM TO BE RUNNED AGAINS EXECUTABLE

WE NEED TO USE chmod COMMAND

LOOK PERMISSIONS OF YOUR JAVASCRIPT FILES

```
ls -la _exercise/shell_scripts/
```

```
drwxrwxr-x 2 rade rade 4096 јун 18 19:44 .
drwxrwxr-x 6 rade rade 4096 јун 18 19:44 ..
-rw-rw-r-- 1 rade rade   35 јун 18 20:04 foo.js
```

AS YOU CAN SEE WE DON'T HAVE EXECUTE PERMISSION, SO WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT

THIS MEANS WE ARE SETTING FILE TO BE ALLOWED TO BE RUNNED AGAINST EXECUTABLE FOR A **USER** (FOR GROUP OR OTHERS IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE) (**x** MEANS EXECUTE)

```
chmod u+x _exercise/shell_scripts/foo.js 
```

LETS CHECK DO WE HAVE PERMISSION NOW

```
ls -l _exercise/shell_scripts/foo.js 
```

IT IS OK NOW

```s
-rwxrw-r-- 1 rade rade 35 јун 18 20:04
```

**NOW WE CAN RUN A PROGRRAM WITHOUT SPECIFING `node` AS EXECUTABLE**

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

"use strict"

// I ADDED THIS
process.stdout.write("Shibonk")

```

**LETS RUN IT**


`_exercise/shell_scripts/foo.js`

IT WORKS, IT DID PRINTED OUT WHAT WE SPECIFIED

# ALWAYS DEFINE SOME HELP OUTPUT INSIDE YOUR SHELL SCRIPTS

WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

"use strict"

process.stdout.write("Shibonk")

getHelp()


// *************************
function getHelp(){
  console.log(`
    foo.js --help

  --help          try getting help
  `)
}
```

RUN IT

```
_exercise/shell_scripts/foo.js
```

OUTPUT

```
Shibonk
    foo.js --help

  --help          try getting help

```
