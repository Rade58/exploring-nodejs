# SQLite3

[LETS INSTALL IT](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-sqlite-on-ubuntu-20-04)

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install sqlite3
```

VERIFY INSTALL

```
sqlite3 --version
```

DATBASE IS GOING TO BE IN FAT BINARY FILE FORMAT, LOCALLY WHERE WE ARE WORKING (IT IS CONVINIENT FOR DEMO PURPOSES, **BUT THIS DATBASE HAS PRODUCTION QUALITIES AND IT IS USED IN A LOT OF PLACES**)

I SAW THAT WEB BROWSERS HAVE SQLite BUILT INT OTHEM

I AM ALSO GOING TO USE NODE PACKAGE CALLED `sqlite3`

```
yarn add sqlite3
```

```
yarn add @types/sqlite3 --dev
```

## WE ARE ALSO GOING TO USE promisify FUNCTION

YOU'LL SE WHY I WANT TO USE THAT FUNCTION

SO I'M INSTALLING `util` PACKAGE

```
yarn add util
```

# LETS ADD SOME SQL WHICH WIL BE OUR INITIAL SETUP

WE WANT TO [ENABLE FOREIGN KEY SUPPORT](https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_enable)

```
touch mydb.sql
```

```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Shiba (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEYS ASC,
  bonkId INTEGER,
  info INTEGER,

  FOREIGN KEY (bonkId) REFERENCES Bonk(id)

);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Bonk (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY ASC,
  info VARCHAR(40) UNIQUE
);

```
