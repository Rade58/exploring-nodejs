# ASYNCHRONICITY AND STREAMS

WE KNOW THAT STREAM OPERATIONS, READING OR WRITING, ARE ASYNCHRONOUS

WE ALREADY TRIED SOME EVENTS

LETS EXPLORE SOME OF THEM AGAIN

```
touch _exercise_2/something.js
```

```js
const {
  createReadStream,
  createWriteStream} = require("fs");


const readStream = createReadStream("_exercise_2/blog-post.mdx");
const writeStream = createWriteStream("_exercise_2/another-blog-post.mdx")

readStream.on("end", () => {
  console.log(`* "end" OF READ STREAM triggers when writing 
* to writable has ended`)
})

writeStream.once("finish", () => {
  console.log(`- "finish" OF WRITE STREAM triggers when writing 
- to writable has finished`)
})

// THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS ASYNCHRONOUSLY
readStream.pipe(writeStream);

```

# WE CAN PROMISYFY THIS OPERATIONS

IT'S BETTER JUST TO WRITE CODE THAN TO LEAVE EXTTENSIVE EXPLANATIONS

```
