# TRANSFORM STREAM DATA

LETS INSTALL  PACKAGE `through2`

- `yarn add through2`

- `yarn add @types/through2 --dev`


[I SHOW YOU HOW TO PIPE OTHER DATA INSIDE STANDARD OUT WRITABLE STREAM](/2.%20STREAMS/1.%20ABOUT%20STREAMS.md); NOW LETS USE PIPE AGAINE, TOGETHER WITH LIBRARY WE INSTALLED, TO DIFINE SOME TRANSFORMATIONS ON CHUNK OF DATA

```js
const {createReadStream} = require("fs")
const through = require("through2")

console.log(process.argv)

// THIS IS GOING TO BE TRANSFORM FUNCTION
// WE WANT TO DEFINE FUNCTION WIH WILL DO UPPERCASE ON
// A CHARACTER

// FUNCTION WILL BE A PARAMETER OF THE through
// FUNCTION, WHUCH WILL CREATE A TRAANSFORM STREAM FOR THE CHUNKS
const writeToUppercase = (chunkBuffer, bufferEncoding, next ) => {
 
    // FIRST ARGUMENT IS ERROR (WE PASSED null FOR THAT)
    // SECOND ARGUMENT IS CHUNK OF DATA FOR WHICH WE DEFINE
    // TRANSFORMATION TO UPPERCASE

    next(null, chunkBuffer.toString().toUpperCase())

    // YOU CALL next FUNCTION WHEN YOU ARE READY TO PROCESS
    // NEXT CHUNK

}


// SO WE TAKE THE CONTENT OF THIS FILE AND CREATE READABLE STREAM
// FROM HIM
// PAY ATTENTION HERE WE USED item 2 (MEANS WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO PASS
// PATH TO THE FILE WHEN STARTING A FILE)
createReadStream(process.argv[2])
// WE CREATE TRANSFORMATIONS STREM TO DO SOME TRANSFORMATION ON A
// CHUNK
.pipe(through(writeToUppercase))
// THAN, AS WE ALSO DID EARLIER, WE CAN "SPILL CHUNK" IN A STANDARRD
// OUT WRITABLE STREAM
.pipe(process.stdout)

// WHEN WE RUN THIS FILE; CONTENT OF THE FILE SHOULD BE
// PRINTED OUT, BUT EVERY CHRACTER SHOULD BE IN UPPER CASE

```

AS I SAID, WE MUST PROVIDE PATH SINCE WE USED `argv[2]` (IF WE WOULD USE `argv[1]` WE WOULDN'T NEED TO PASS A PATH)

```
node /path to file/my_file.js /path to file/my_file.js
```

YOU'LL SEE A PRINTED OUT ENTIRE FILE

# LETS PLAY WITH A STANDARD INPUT

**WHEN YOU TEND TO USE STANDARD INPUT PROGRAM TENDS TO HANG; I THINK I SHOWED YOU THIS BEFORE**

STANDARD INPUT IS ALSO A STREAM LIKE I SAID

BUT IF YOU USE IT IN YOUR PROGRAM YOUR PROGRAM WON'T END; YOU NEET TO INITIATE STOP OF THE PROCESS WITH `process.exit()`, OR PRES `Ctrl` `+` `C`

**I WANT TO CREATE PROGRAM WHERE OUR STANDARD INPUT WOULD BE TRANSFORMED TO UPPER CASE**

# WE USED `through2`; BUT WE ALSO COULD HAVE USED BUILT IN SOLUTION

```js
const {createReadStream} = require("fs")
// W WILL USE THIS CONSTRUCTOR
const {Transform} = require("stream")

const through = require("through2")


const writeToUppercase = (chunkBuffer, bufferEncoding, next ) => {
  
  next(null, chunkBuffer.toString().toUpperCase())
}

// WE WILL BUILD A Transform INSTANCE
const transform = new Transform({
  // FUNCTION ABOVE WILL BE ASSIGNA AS transform OPTION
  transform: writeToUppercase
})
// WHICH WE CAN USE AS pipe ARGUMENT

process.stdin
// INSTEAD OF THIS
// .pipe(through(writeToUppercase))
// WE WILL USE THIS
.pipe(transform)
// 
.pipe(process.stdout)
```

# YOU CAN ALSO INSTALL AND USE `"readable-stream"` PACKAGE FROM npm

WHICH WOULD BE A BETTER CHOICE BECAUSE IT IS MAINTAINED PRETTY GOOD

# WITH `Transform` YOU AREE ABLE TO USE SOMETHING CALLED `flush`

IT'S A FUNCTION THAT IS CALLED WHEN STREAM PROCESSES ITS LAST CHUNK

```js
const {createReadStream} = require("fs")
// W WILL USE THIS CONSTRUCTOR
const {Transform} = require("stream")

const through = require("through2")

const writeToUppercase = (chunkBuffer, bufferEncoding, next ) => {  
  next(null, chunkBuffer.toString().toUpperCase())
}

const transform = new Transform({
  transform: writeToUppercase,
  // this is flush
  flush: (callback) => {
    // 
    console.log("flushing")
  }
})

createReadStream(process.argv[2])
//
.pipe(transform)
//
.pipe(process.stdout)
```

# THERE IS ALSO `flush` WHEN YOU USE `through2` AND THAT'S A THIRD ARGUMENT OF `through2` 

YOU CAN TRY TO DO THAT BY YOURSELF

# MOST OF THE TIME YOU CALL next() FUNCTION WITH A DATA THAT WAS PROCESSED; BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THAT ALL THE TIME

BUT NOT ALAYS EVERY PEACE OF DATA CORRESPONDS TO OUTPUT

IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PASS ANY DAT, YOU WOULD USE `push` FUNCTION
