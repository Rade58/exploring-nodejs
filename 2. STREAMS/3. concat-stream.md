# concat-stream

- `yarn add concat-stream`

> Writable stream that concatenates all the data from a stream and calls a callback with the result. Use this when you want to collect all the data from a stream into a single buffer.
> Streams emit many buffers. If you want to collect all of the buffers, and when the stream ends **concatenate all of the buffers together and receive a single buffer** then this is the module for you.
> Only use this if you know you can fit all of the output of your stream into a single Buffer (e.g. in RAM).

**SO IMPORTANT THINK TO KNOW HERE IS THAT THIS STREAM CAN ONLY BE A WRITABLE STREAM**

SO WE CONACATANATE MANY BUFFERS INTO HIM

READING IS NOT POSSIBLE FROM THIS STREAM

MMEORY COULD BE PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE DATA IS WRITTEN TO MEMORY
