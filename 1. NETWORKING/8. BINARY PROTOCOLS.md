# BINARY PROTOCOLS

GOOD EXAMPLE FOR THIS PROTOCOL IS `ssh` PROTOCOL

http, smtp, irc ARE TEXT BASED PROTOCOL THAT ARE EASY TO CAMPTURE OR TO INSPCT

BINARY PROTOCOLS ARE A BIT HARDER

# SSH PROTOCOL

PORT IS 22

TRY CONNECTING WITH NETCAT

```
nc google.com 22
```

I GUESS YOU WOULD EE NOTHING

**YOU NEED CUSTOM PROGRAMS TO RUN SSH PROTOCOL**
