# HTTP CORE STREAMS

DEPENDING ON WHERE ARE THEY USED, REQUEST AND RESPONSE CAN BE A DIFFERENT TYPE OF STREAMS

WHEN SENDING REQUEST FOR EXAMPLE WITH fetch OR axios OR SIMILAR, REQUEST IS WRITABLE STREAM; AND RESPONSE IS READABLE STREAM

ON SERVER REQUEST IS READABLE STREAM AND RESPONSE IS WRITABLE

SEE THE EXAMPLE

LETS CREATE SERVER FIRST

`_exercise/my_server.js`

```js
const {createServer} = require("http");
const {createReadStream, createWriteStream} = require("fs")

// LETS CREATE WRITABLE
// AND PIPE DATA FROM THE  REQUEST INTO SOME FILE

// LETS ALSO PIPE SOME DATA INTO RESPONSE

const server = createServer(async (req, res) => {
  // 
  if(req.method === "POST"){
    // 
    const writable = createWriteStream("_exercise/data.json")

    req.pipe(writable);
    

    // WHEN WRITING ENDS, WE SHOULD END
    req.once("end", () => {
      
      writable.end()
      
      // RESPONSE IS ALSO WRITABLE
      // LETS WRITE SOME THINGS TO IT

      // AS YOU REMEMBER, WE CAN USE  .write
      // AND WE EXECUTE .end TO CLOSE THE STREAM

      // OR YOU DON'T NEED TO USE write AND PASS WHAT YOU WANT
      // TO THE .end

      // BUT LETS CREATE A NEW READABLE FROM THE FILE
      // WE JUST WRITTED TO
      const readable = createReadStream("_exercise/data.json")


      // WHEN READING ENDS

      readable.once("end", () => {

        res.statusCode = 201;
        
        
        res.end()
      })
      
      res.setHeader("Content-type", "application/json")
      
      readable.pipe(res)
      

    })

  }else {

    res.statusCode = 400;
    res.statusMessage("Wrong method")
    res.end()

  }

})

server.listen(3006,() => console.log("listening on port 3006"))
```

I TESTED ABOVE SERVER WITH HTTPI AND IT WORKS

`http POST :3006 hello=world`

LETS CREATE CLIENT

`_exercise/my_client.js`

```js
const {request} = require("http");

// MAYBE HERE WE CAN USE STANDARD IN LIKE A
// WAY TO PRIVIDE DATA FOR THE REQUEST


const req = request({
  host: "localhost",
  port: 3006,
  url: "/",
  method: "POST",


}, (res) => {

})

process.stdin.once("end", () => {
  
  req.end()

})

process.stdin.pipe(req)
```

EXECUTE IT

```
node _exercise/my_client.js
```


DON'T FORGET TO PRESS `ctrl + d` TO END STANDARD INPUT

IT WORKS
