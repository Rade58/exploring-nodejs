# CRYPTO STREAMS

I DID LOOK INTO NODJS NATIVE [crypto](/3.%20crypto/NOTES.md) PACKAGE EARLIER; I DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION ON FCT THAT ALL DIFFERENT METHODS ARE STREAMS

I WILL DO SOME EXAMPLES WITH THEM NOW

```js
// THIS FUNCTION PRODUCES TRANSITION STREAM
const {createHash} = require("crypto");

// WE CAN USE STANDARD IN AND PIPE IT TO THE HASH STREAM, AND PIPE THAT AGAIN TO STANDATRD OUT
// TO PRINT OUT HASH

// REMEMBER THAT YOU CAN CHANGE EMCODING OF HASH
// IT IS BINARY BE DEFAULT
// I WANT HEX

process.stdin
  .pipe(createHash("sha256", {encoding: "hex"}))
  .pipe(process.stdout);

```

TEST YOUR STANDARD INPUT

TO CONFIRM IT IS THE SAME YOU CAN ALSO RUN A TERMINAL COMAND THAT WOULD HASH SOME VALUE

FIRST LETS OUTPUT HASH FROM OUR PROGRAM

```
echo -n "Hello World" | node exercise/crypto/ha.js
```

HASH IS OUTPUTED

LETS RUN A COMMAND `shasum`

```
echo -n "Hello World" | shasum -a 256
```

**WE HAVE A MATCHING HASHES**


# IT IS GOOD IDEA TO STORE A HASH OF UPLOADED FILE

IF SOMEONE TRIES TO UPLOAD A SAME FILE, YOU WOULD COMPARE HASHES AND YOU WOULD SEE IF YOU ALREADY HAVE SAME FILE IN YOUR DATBASE
