# ROUTING AND SERVING STATIC FILES

I AM GOING TO USE SERVER PACKAGE FOR STATIC FILES

THIS PACKAGE DOESN'T HAVE ANY TYPESCRIPT SUPPORT (JUST POINTING THAT OUT, SO YOU NEED TO READ DOCS)

```
yarn add node-static-alias
```

WE ARE GOING TO CREATE NEW FILE CALLED `file-server.ts`

```
touch web_server/file-server.ts
```
