# Zlib

THESE ARE STREMAS THAT DEAL WITH COMPRESSION

![zlib](../_IMG/ZLIB.png)

## LETS FIRST PLAY AROUND WITH COMPRESSION IN COMMAND LINE

WE CREATED ORIGINAL FILE `_exercise/zlib/helloworld.txt`

WE WILL CREATE GZIPED VERSION OF MENTIONED FILE IN THE SAME FOLDER

```
gzip -<_exercise/zlib/helloworld.txt > _exercise/zlib/helloworld.txt.gz
```

**YOU CAN SEE CONYENTS OF COMPRESSED FILE WITH THIS:**

```
gunzip <_exercise/zlib/helloworld.txt.gz 
```

# LETS CREATE EXAMPLE IN NODEJS

```js

```
