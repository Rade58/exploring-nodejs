# STANDARD IN AND OUT

**PLAYING WITH THIS YOU WILL UNDERSTAND HOW NODE IS ACTUALLY RUNNED, AND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN USE NODE TO WRITE PROGRAMS THAT DO THE SAME THINGS AS BASH SCRIPTS**

```
touch _exercise/exploring_node/standard_in_and_out.js
```

```js
// A READ STREAM THAT TAKES PROVIDED DATA FROM ENVIRONMENT
process.stdin
  // 
  // PIPING CHUNKS TO THE STANDARD OUT WHICH IS THE WRITE STREAM
  .pipe(process.stdout)
```

```
echo "Hello" | node _exercise/exploring_node/standard_in_and_out.js
```

OR JUST RUN WITHOUT ECHO AND THAN TYPE IN DATA (INPUT STOPS WITH CTRL + D)

OR ECHO IN ENTIRE FILE

LIKE THIS

```
cat _exercise/data.json | node _exercise/exploring_node/standard_in_and_out.js
```

OR LIKE THIS

```
node _exercise/exploring_node/standard_in_and_out.js < _exercise/data.json
```

# TRAILING NEW LINE

**WHEN WRITING TO STANDARD OUT YOU NEED TO BE SPECIFIC ABOUT NEW LINES**

`_exercise/exploring_node/standard_in_and_out.js`

```js
// BECAUSE WRITING TO STANDARD OUTPUT STREAM
process.stdout.write("Hello World")
```

WILL PRODUCE, THIS KIND OF OUTPUT

```
eidolon@eidolon:~/PROJECTS/educational/nodejs-web-security-workshop$ node _exercise/exploring_node/standard_in_and_out.js 
Hello Worldeidolon@eidolon:~/PROJECTS/educational/nodejs-web-security-workshop$ 
```

SEE HOW THERE'S NO NEW LINE AFTER "Hello World"

WHEN USING `console.log` NEW LINE IS INCLUDED

```js
console.log("Hello World")
```

OUTPUT

```
eidolon@eidolon:~/PROJECTS/educational/nodejs-web-security-workshop$ node _exercise/exploring_node/standard_in_and_out.js 
Hello World
eidolon@eidolon:~/PROJECTS/educational/nodejs-web-security-workshop$ 
```

**WHEN YOU'RE DOING STANDARD OUT JUST INCLUDE NEW LINE**
