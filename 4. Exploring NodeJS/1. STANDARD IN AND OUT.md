# STANDARD IN AND OUT

**PLAYING WITH THIS YOU WILL UNDERSTAND HOW NODE IS ACTUALLY RUNNED, AND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN USE NODE TO WRITE PROGRAMS THAT DO THE SAME THINGS AS BASH SCRIPTS**

```
touch _exercise/exploring_node/standard_in_and_out.js
```

```js
// A READ STREAM THAT TAKES PROVIDED DATA FROM ENVIRONMENT
process.stdin
  // 
  // PIPING CHUNKS TO THE STANDARD OUT WHICH IS THE WRITE STREAM
  .pipe(process.stdout)
```

```
echo "Hello" | node _exercise/exploring_node/standard_in_and_out.js
```

OR JUST RUN WITHOUT ECHO AND THAN TYPE IN DATA

OR ECHO IN ENTIRE FILE

LIKE THIS

```
cat _exercise/data.json | node _exercise/exploring_node/standard_in_and_out.js
```

OR LIKE THIS

```
node _exercise/exploring_node/standard_in_and_out.js < _exercise/data.json
```
