# READABLE STREAM

WE WERE USING JUST pipe BEFORE; WE PIPED CHUNKS TO THE WRITABLE OR TRNANSFORMATION STREAM

IT HAS MORE METHODS, LIKE read BUT YOU SHOULDN'T USE THEM BY YOURSELF SINCE IT IS ERROR PRONE

red WILL BE CALLED BY pipe UNDER THE HOOD

# paused MODE AND flowing MODE OF READABLE STREAMS

BY DEFAULT THEY ARE IN PAUSED MODE **THEY ARE ONLY GOING TO PRODUCE DATA WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY CONSUMING DATA**

BECAUSE OF DEALING WITH BACKPRESSURE

## I WON'T GET INTO DUPLEX STREAMS

YOU CAN LOOK AT THEM

YOU CAN START WITH USING "net" BUILT IN PACKAGE

YOU CAN CREATE ECHO SERVER, AND THINGS LIKE THAT
