# USING STANDARD INPUT

**WE HAVE SAID THAT WE SHOULD AVOID USING OF `process.stdin.read` BECAUSE READABLE STREAMS ARE EASY TO MESS UP**

**WE USED .pipe BEFORE AND WE USED PACKAGES LIKE `through2` `split2` `concat-stream`**

**BUT THERE ARE MORE PACKAGES**

WE WILL USE THIS ONE

[get-stdin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/get-stdin)
