# TRANSFORM STREAM

LAST TIME WE WERE USING THINGS LIKE `"through2"`, `"conct-stream"`, `"split2"`

WE ALSO TRIED `Transform` CONSTRUCTOR FROM NATIVE PACKAGE `"stream"`

LETS SEE EXAMPLE

```
code _exercise_2/foobar.js
```

```js

```

## I WANT TO ALTER EXAMPLE A BIT IN ORDER TO EXPLICITLY SHOW YOU THAT THERE ARE MANY BUFFERS "FLOWING" IN BETWEEN READABLE AND WRITIBLE WHEN YOU'RE PIPING

I ASUME THAT IN NODEJS THERE IS DEFAULT SETTED OF HOW BIG A BUFFER SHOULD BE WHEN PIPING HAPPENS, AND ACORDING TO THAT IT IS DETERMINED HOW BIG CN BE THE "FLOWING" CHUNKS
