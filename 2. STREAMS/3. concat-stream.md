```

> Writable stream that concatenates all the data from a stream and calls a callback with the result. Use this when you want to collect all the data from a stream into a single buffer.
> Streams emit many buffers. If you want to collect all of the buffers, and when the stream ends **concatenate all of the buffers together and receive a single buffer** then this is the module for you.
> Only use this if you know you can fit all of the output of your stream into a single Buffer (e.g. in RAM).

**SO IMPORTANT THINK TO KNOW HERE IS THAT THIS STREAM CAN ONLY BE A WRITABLE STREAM**

SO WE CONACATANATE MANY BUFFERS INTO HIM

READING IS NOT POSSIBLE FROM THIS STREAM

MEMORY COULD BE PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE DATA IS WRITTEN TO MEMORY

file `_exercise/concat-stream.js`

```js
const concat = require("concat-stream");

// LETS CALCULATE LENGHT IN BYTES FOR STANDARD INPUT

process.stdin.pipe(concat((buf) => {
  console.log(buf.length)
}))
// THIS CAN'T BE PIPED ANYMORE SINCE CONCAT WAS THE WRITABLE STREAM
```

```
node _exercise/concat-stream.js
```

YOU WRITE INPUT AND PRESS ENTER, AS MUCH AS YOU WANT
BUT WHEN YOU DECIDE TO EXIT INPUT, YOU CAN PRES ENTER LAST TIME, AND THEN YOU CAN EXIT STANDARD INPUT WITH `Ctrl + D`

YOU WILL SE BYTES LOGGED IN TERMINAL
