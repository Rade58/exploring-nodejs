# SERVING STATIC FILES WITH EXPRESS

LETS SEE HOW WE SERVEED STATIC FILES WITHOUT EXPRESS

WE HAD TO WRITE ALL OF THIS RULES; AND WE WERE USING PACKAGE "node-static-alias"; THAT WORKED PRETTY MUCH BY SENDING req AND res TO THAT PACKAGE, AND THEN THAT PACKAGE DIDI SOME MAGIC WITH RULES THAT WE PROVIDED SO FROM ONE HANDLER WE HAD, WHEN NETWORK REQUEST HAPPENED

```
cat web_server/file-server.ts
```

```ts
// @ts-ignore
import {Server} from 'node-static-alias'
import path from 'path'

const WEB_FILES_PATH = path.resolve(__dirname, "web_files");


const createFileServer = () => {

  const fileServer = new Server(WEB_FILES_PATH, {
    cache: 100,
    serverInfo: "Shibatoshi Workshop",
    alias: [
 
      {
        match: /^\/(?:index\/?)?(?:[?#].*$)?$/,
        serve: "index.html",
        force: true,
      },
      {
        match: /^\/js\/.+$/,
        serve: "<% absPath %>",
        force: true,
      },
      {
        match: /^\/(?:[\w\d]+)(?:[\/?#].*$)?$/,
        serve: function onMatch(params: any) {
                return `${params.basename}.html`;
        },
      },
      {
        match: /[^]/,
        serve: "404.html",
      }

    ]
  })
  
  return fileServer;

}

// WE WERE USING THIS FUNCTION IN HANDLER
// WE WERE PASSING IT req AND res

export default createFileServer;
```
