# SQLite

I AM GOING TO USE NODE PACKAGE `sqlite3`

DATBASE IS GOING TO BE IN FAT BINARY FILE FORMAT, LOCALLY WHERE WE ARE WORKING (IT IS CONVINIENT FOR DEMO PURPOSES, **BUT THIS DATBASE HAS PRODUCTION QUALITIES AND IT IS USED IN A LOT OF PLACES**)

I SAW THAT WEB BROWSERS HAVE SQLite BUILT INT OTHEM
