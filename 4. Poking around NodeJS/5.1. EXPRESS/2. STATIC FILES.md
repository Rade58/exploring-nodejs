# SERVING STATIC FILES WITH EXPRESS

LETS SEE HOW WE SERVEED STATIC FILES BEFORE

WE HAD TO WRITE ALL OF THIS RULES; AND WE WERE USING PACKAGE "node-static-alias"; THAT WORKED PRETTY MUCH BY SENDING req AND res TO THAT PACKAGE, AND THEN THAT PACKAGE DID SOME MAGIC WITH RULES THAT WE PROVIDED SO FROM ONE HANDLER WE HAD, WHEN NETWORK REQUEST HAPPENED

**PRETTY MUCH REQ AND RESPONSE DID PROPAGATE AND THEY CHARACTERISTICS (req.url TO BE PRECISE) WERE RUNED AGAINST REGEX**


```
cat web_server/file-server.ts
```

```ts
// @ts-ignore
import {Server} from 'node-static-alias'
import path from 'path'

const WEB_FILES_PATH = path.resolve(__dirname, "web_files");


const createFileServer = () => {

  const fileServer = new Server(WEB_FILES_PATH, {
    cache: 100,
    serverInfo: "Shibatoshi Workshop",
    alias: [
 
      {
        match: /^\/(?:index\/?)?(?:[?#].*$)?$/,
        serve: "index.html",
        force: true,
      },
      {
        match: /^\/js\/.+$/,
        serve: "<% absPath %>",
        force: true,
      },
      {
        match: /^\/(?:[\w\d]+)(?:[\/?#].*$)?$/,
        serve: function onMatch(params: any) {
                return `${params.basename}.html`;
        },
      },
      {
        match: /[^]/,
        serve: "404.html",
      }

    ]
  })
  
  return fileServer;

}

// WE WERE USING THIS FUNCTION IN HANDLER
// WE WERE PASSING IT req AND res

export default createFileServer;
```

## LET SERVE STATIC FILES WITH EXPRESS

**EXPRESS ALSO UNDER THE HOOD USES PAKAGE `node-static`**
