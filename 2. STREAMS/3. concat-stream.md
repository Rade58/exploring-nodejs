> Writable stream that concatenates all the data from a stream and calls a callback with the result. Use this when you want to collect all the data from a stream into a single buffer.
> Streams emit many buffers. If you want to collect all of the buffers, and when the stream ends **concatenate all of the buffers together and receive a single buffer** then this is the module for you.
> Only use this if you know you can fit all of the output of your stream into a single Buffer (e.g. in RAM).

**SO IMPORTANT THINK TO KNOW HERE IS THAT THIS STREAM CAN ONLY BE A WRITABLE STREAM**

SO WE CONACATANATE MANY BUFFERS INTO HIM

READING IS NOT POSSIBLE FROM THIS STREAM

MEMORY COULD BE PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE DATA IS WRITTEN TO MEMORY

# THIS CONCEPT IS MAYBE HARD FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND


BUT IT IS ONLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND ONE THING

BUT WHEN YOU LOOK THOSE TRANSFORMATIONS WE WERE DEALING IN PREVIOUS LECTION, IT IS GOOD TO MAKE SOME COMPARISSON

WITH TRNSFORMATION METHODS YOU DEFINE WHAT YOU CAN DO ON ONLY ONE CHUNK, AND SPECIFIED THING IS DONE PROCEDURALLY ON CHUNK BY CHUNK BASIS

**USING concat I GUESS DEFIES BENEFITS OF STREAMS BECAUSE YOU ARE CREATING BIG BUFFER FROM ALL CHUNKS, THERFORE YOU ARE TAKING TOO MUCH MEMORY**

BUT THERE ARE SOME USE CASES FOR THIS

# EXAMPLE

file `_exercise/concat-stream.js`

```js
const concat = require("concat-stream");
const through = require("through2")


// LETS CALCULATE LENGHT IN BYTES FOR STANDARD INPUT
process.stdin.pipe(concat((buf) => {
  console.log(`LENGTH OF ENTIRE STANDARD INPUT ${buf.length}`)
}));
// THIS CAN'T BE PIPED ANYMORE SINCE CONCAT WAS THE WRITABLE STREAM


// BUT LETS DO TRANSITIONAL METHOD AGAIN
// LETS PRINT OUT LENGHTH OF EVERY BUFFER
process.stdin.pipe(through((chunkBuffer,buffEncoding, next) => {

  console.log(chunkBuffer.length)
  next()
}));
```

```
node _exercise/concat-stream.js
```

YOU WRITE INPUT AND PRESS ENTER,
AFTER THAT LENGTH IS PRINTED; THATS A LENGTH OF ONE CHUNK
YOU CAN REPAT MENTIONED STEPS MULTIPLE TIMES

BUT WHEN YOU DECIDE TO EXIT INPUT
THEN YOU CAN EXIT STANDARD INPUT WITH `Ctrl + D`

YOU WILL SE LOGGED IN THE TRMINAL ALL SUMA OF BYTES WE SAW BEFORE

# LETS DO A MORE "REAL WORDLY" EXAMPLE WHERE WE WOULD HAVE WEB SERVER

LETS SAY WE NEED TO THROW ERROR IF OUR API ROUTE GETS DATA ABOVE 26 BYTES

```
touch _exercise/server.js
```

```js
const http = require("http")
const concat = require("concat-stream")

const server = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {

  // USED HERE POST FOR NO REASON
  // IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANY REQUEST METHOD BECAUSE THIS WAN'T A POINT I'M MAKING

  if(req.method !== "POST") {
    res.statusCode = 404
    return res.end();
  }
  
  // YOU NEED TO KNOW THIS ONE THING
  // req    IS ALSO A READABLE STREAM
  
  // SO WE CAN USE pipe

  req.pipe(concat((buff) => {

    // IT IS OBVIOUS WHAT WE DID HERE

    if(buff.length > 26) {
      res.statusCode = 416
      res.statusMessage = "bytes of body exceeded"
      return res.end()
    }else{
      res.statusCode = 200
      res.end("ok")
    }
    
  }))

})


server.listen(4666, () => {
  console.log("server started")
})

```

LETS TEST THIS OUT WITH HTTPIE

FOR SECCESSFUL REQUEST WE CAN DO THIS

```
http POST :4666 hello=world
```

FOR A FAILED ONE LETS DO THIS

```
http POST :4666 hello=worldfoobarbaz
```

## JUST FOR YOU TO KNOW, WHEN USING concat YOU CAN PASS AN OPTION TO GET STRING INSTEAD OF BUFFER

WE WILL CHANGE EXAMPLE A BIT FOR YOU TO SEE

```js
const http = require("http")
const querystring = require("querystring")
const concat = require("concat-stream")

const server = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {

  if(req.method !== "POST") {
    res.statusCode = 404
    return res.end();
  }
  
  
  req.pipe(concat(
    // WITH THIS ARGUMENT
    {encoding: "string"}
    ,
    // THIS IS NO LONGER BUFFER
    (buff) => {
    
    // IT IS A QUERYSTRING E CAN PARSE LIKE THIS
    const data = querystring.parse(buff)

    console.log(typeof data === "object")
    console.log({data})


    if(buff.length > 26) {
      res.statusCode = 416
      res.statusMessage = "Range exceeded"
      return res.end()
    }else{
      res.statusCode = 200
      res.end("ok")
    }
    
  }))

})


server.listen(6661, () => {
  console.log("server started")
})
```

ALSO AS YOU CAN SEE WE USED querystring LEGACY INTERFACE TO PARSE QUERYSTRING

TESTING IT OUT

```
curl -X POST -d message=hello -d foo=bar 'http://localhost:6661'
```

# WE COULD DID OUR EXAMPLE A BETTER; WE COULD HAVE USED COUNTER TOGETHER WITH through

WE WOULD COUNT BYTES FROM "CHUNK ITERATION TO CHUNK ITERATION"

SEE EXAMPLE, IT I NOT PERFECT I HAVE SOME PROBLEM

TRY FIXING IT

```js
const http = require("http")
const querystring = require("querystring")
const concat = require("concat-stream")
const through = require("through2")

const server = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {

  let byteCounter = 0
  
  req.pipe(through(function (chunkBuff, buffEncoding, next){

    
    byteCounter += chunkBuff.length;
    console.log({byteCounter})
    
    if(byteCounter > 26) {
      res.statusCode = 416
      res.statusMessage = "Range exceeded"


      return res.end()
    }else{
      next(null, "")
    }
    

  }))


  
  // res.statusCode = 200
  // return  res.end("ok")
  

})


server.listen(6661, () => {
  console.log("server started")
})

```
