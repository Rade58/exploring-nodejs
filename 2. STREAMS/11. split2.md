# BUFFERING BY LINE WITH split2

```
yarn add split2 && yarn add @types/split2 --dev      
```

IT IS BETTER IF I SHOW YOU THIS BY EXAMPLE

SEE THIS TEXT FILE (NOTICE HOW HE HAS MANY NEW LINES)

```
cat _exercise/currencies.txt
```

```txt
Shiba Inu
Bitcoin
SafeMoon
Hedera Hashgraph
Ethereum
Monero
```

LETS USE THIS FILE AS A READABLE STREAM

`_exercise/splitting.js`

```js
const {createReadStream} = require("fs")
const through2 = require("through2")
const split2 = require("split2")


createReadStream("_exercise/currencies.txt")
  .pipe(through2((buffChunk, buffEnc, next) => {

    // LETS LOG THE CHUNKS
    console.log(buffChunk)

    next()
  }))
  .pipe(process.stdout)

```


```
node node _exercise/splitting.js
```

THIS IS WHAT IS GOING TO BE ACTUALLY PRINTED

```
<Buffer 53 68 69 62 61 20 49 6e 75 0a 42 69 74 63 6f 69 6e 0a 53 61 66 65 4d 6f 6f 6e 0a 48 65 64 65 72 61 20 48 61 73 68 67 72 61 70 68 0a 45 74 68 65 72 65 ... 9 more bytes>
```

**SO APPARENTLY WE HAVE ONLY ONE BUFFER PRINTED, SO THAT MEANS WE ONLY HAVE ONE CHUNK IN THIS STREAM**

**WHAT IF YOU WANT TO SPLIT EVERYTHING IN SMALL BUFFERS AND YOU WANT THE NEW LINE TO BE AS A MARKER WHERE YOU WOULD SPLIT**

YOU CAN DO THI WITH `split2` METHOD

```js
const {createReadStream} = require("fs")
const through2 = require("through2")
const split2 = require("split2")


createReadStream("_exercise/currencies.txt")
  // WE ADDD THIS
  .pipe(split2())
  // 
  .pipe(through2((buffChunk, buffEnc, next) => {

    // AND NOW WE WILL HAVE MANY MORE CHUNKS
    console.log(buffChunk)

    next()
  }))
  .pipe(process.stdout)

```

NOW, LETS RUN THE PROGRAM

```
node node _exercise/splitting.js
```

**NOW IN THE OUTPUT YOU WILL SE MANY CHUNKS**

```
<Buffer 53 68 69 62 61 20 49 6e 75>
<Buffer 42 69 74 63 6f 69 6e>
<Buffer 53 61 66 65 4d 6f 6f 6e>
<Buffer 48 65 64 65 72 61 20 48 61 73 68 67 72 61 70 68>
<Buffer 45 74 68 65 72 65 75 6d>
<Buffer 4d 6f 6e 65 72 6f>
```
