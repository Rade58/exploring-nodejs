# SHEBANG

YOU CAN PUT A "SHEBANG" COMMENT AT THE TOP OF THE FILE; WHICH WILL TELL SHELL ENVIRONMENT, THAT WHEN IT STARTS TO EXECUTE IT KNOWS WHAT PROGRAMS TO HAND THAT EXECUTION TO 

SYNTAX LOOKS LIKE THIS: **`#! <path of the file to use for interpretation>`**

# EXECUTABLE

WE GOT OT SAY TO SCRIPT WHERE TO FIND NODE EXECUTABLE IN OUR SYSTEM

WE ARE DOING THIS BY ADDING SHEBANG WHERE WE SPECIFY THE PATH TO NOODEJS

```
touch _exercise/bash_scripts/foo.js
```

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
```

WITH THIS WE ARE TELLING: *"GO FIND NODE WHERE EVER IT IS ON THE SYSTEM AND USE NODE TO INTERPRET THE REST OF MY PROGRAM"*

# YOU SHOULD BE ALWAYS RUNNING CODE IN STRICT MODE

DON'T WORRY WHEN PUTTING SHEBNG ABOVE "use strict" BECAUSE WHEN OUR CODE GETS EUNNED IT IS GOING TO BE STRIPPED FROM THE FILEL SHEBANG WONT BE THERE ANYMORE

I AM TELLING YOU THIS BECAUSE NORMALLY WHEN YOU'RE USING STRICT MODE `"use strict"` NEEDS TO BE ON TOP OF THE FILE

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

"use strict"
```
