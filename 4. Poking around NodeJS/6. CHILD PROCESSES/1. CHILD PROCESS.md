# CHILD PROCESS

BACK AGAIN AT COMMAND LINE; GOING LOW LEVEL

I'M GOING TO LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITH NODE ACROSS MULTIPLE PROCESS INSTANCES

SPECIFICALLY I WANT TO LEARN HOW TO SPIN OFF CHILD PROCESSES FROM A MAIN NODE PROCESS, AND HOW TO COMMUNICATE BETWEEN PROCESSES

# LETS PREPARE OUR COMMND LINE SCRIPT; THIS TIME WE ARE GOING TO USE `ts-node`

***

**JUST KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE SLOW BECAUSE TRANSPILATION OF TYPESCRIPT CODE**

**+

```
mkdir cp && touch cp/index.ts && code cp/index.ts
```

```js
#!/usr/bin/env ts-node
"use strict"

console.log("Hello world")
```

```
chmod u+x cp/index.ts
```

```
cp/index.ts
```

IT WORKS

# USING BUILT IN MODULE `"child_process"`

ITS BETTER TO START WITH EXAMPLE

OUR FIRST EVER CHILD PROCESS IS GOING TO BE THIS CODE IN THIS FILE

```
touch cp/child1.ts
```

```ts
import {createReadStream, createWriteStream} from 'fs'

const readable = createReadStream("_exercise/server2.js");

const writeable = createWriteStream("cp/hello.js")

readable.pipe(writeable);
```

AS YOU CAN SE WE ARE USING STREAMS ANDD AS A END GAME WE WILL HAVE A CREATION OF NEW FILE (YOU KNOW HOW BECAUSE WE COVERED THE STREAMS EARLIER)

**LETS DEFINE RUNNING OF THIS CHILD PROCESS FROM THE FILE CALLED PARENT**

IT'S A FIE WE ALREADY PREPARED TO BE A COMMAND LINE SCRIPT

```
code cp/index.ts
```

```ts
#!/usr/bin/env ts-node
"use strict"

import childProc from 'child_process'
import {promisify} from 'util'


main()


function main(){
  
  // LETS SPAWN OUR FIRST EVER CHILD PROCESS
  const child = childProc.spawn("ts-node", ["cp/child1.ts"])

  child.on("exit", (code, signal) => {
    // THIS IS GOING TO BE PRINTED WHEN 
    // CHILD PROCESS FINISHES ITS OWN RUN
    console.log({code, signal})
  } )

}

```

**LETS RUN IT**

```
cp/index.ts
```

OUR CHILD PROCESS DID CREATE A NEW FILE IN `cp` FOLDER
