# STANDARD IN AND OUT

REMEMBER `console.log` FUNCTIONS; THE TRUTH IS THAT, IT IS JUST A WRAPPER AROUND `process.stdout`

**PLAYING WITH STANDARD OUT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND HOW NODE IS ACTUALLY RUNNED, AND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN USE NODE TO WRITE PROGRAMS THAT DO THE SAME THINGS AS BASH SCRIPTS**

```
touch _exercise/exploring_node/standard_in_and_out.js
```

```js
// A READ STREAM THAT TAKES PROVIDED DATA FROM ENVIRONMENT
process.stdin
  // 
  // PIPING CHUNKS TO THE STANDARD OUT WHICH IS THE WRITE STREAM
  .pipe(process.stdout)
```

```
echo "Hello" | node _exercise/exploring_node/standard_in_and_out.js
```

OR JUST RUN WITHOUT ECHO AND THAN TYPE IN DATA (INPUT STOPS WITH CTRL + D)

OR ECHO IN ENTIRE FILE

LIKE THIS

```
cat _exercise/data.json | node _exercise/exploring_node/standard_in_and_out.js
```

OR LIKE THIS

```
node _exercise/exploring_node/standard_in_and_out.js < _exercise/data.json
```

# TRAILING NEW LINE

**WHEN WRITING TO STANDARD OUT YOU NEED TO BE SPECIFIC ABOUT NEW LINES**

`_exercise/exploring_node/standard_in_and_out.js`

```js
// BECAUSE WRITING TO STANDARD OUTPUT STREAM
process.stdout.write("Hello World")
```

WILL PRODUCE, THIS KIND OF OUTPUT

```
eidolon@eidolon:~/PROJECTS/educational/nodejs-web-security-workshop$ node _exercise/exploring_node/standard_in_and_out.js 
Hello Worldeidolon@eidolon:~/PROJECTS/educational/nodejs-web-security-workshop$ 
```

SEE HOW THERE'S NO NEW LINE AFTER "Hello World"

WHEN USING `console.log` NEW LINE IS INCLUDED

```js
console.log("Hello World")
```

OUTPUT

```
eidolon@eidolon:~/PROJECTS/educational/nodejs-web-security-workshop$ node _exercise/exploring_node/standard_in_and_out.js 
Hello World
eidolon@eidolon:~/PROJECTS/educational/nodejs-web-security-workshop$ 
```

**WHEN YOU'RE DOING STANDARD OUTPUT JUST INCLUDE NEW LINE, IF YOU WANT NEW LINE OFCOURSE**

## `console.error` IS A WRAPPER AROUND `process.stderr`

**BUT WHEN YOU LOG ERROR, OR YOU WRITE TO `process.stderr` NOTHING SEEMS TO BE DIFFERENT INSIDE TERMINAL; WE SEE JUST SEE PRINTED TEXT; AND NOTHING SEEMS TO SIGNAL THAT ERROR IS THE THING THAT IS**

# WE NEED TO USE REDIRECTION OF FILE DESCRIPTORS TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN `process.stderr` AND `process.stdout`

ON A LINUX SYSTEMS THERE IS THIS FILE:
