# FILE HANDLING WITH STREAMS

THIS PART ABOUT STREAMS IS GOING TO BE REALLY A RESUME OF WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT STREAMS EARLIER; ALSO I WANT TO INTRODUCE SOME NEW HELPUF RESOURCES

**THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST REESOURCE FOR STREAMS**

[streams handbook by substack](https://github.com/substack/stream-handbook)

## THE THINGS WE DIDN'T NOTICE BEFORE ABOUT READABLE STREAM AND ITS `pipe` METHOD

I DIDN'T NOTICE BFORE THAT **RETURN VALUE** OF THE `readable.pipe()` **IS COMPLETELY A NEW READABLE STREAM** 

```js
const readable2 = readable1.pipe(writable)
```

**THIS IS BECAUSE OF CHAINING OF `pipe` METHODS**

```js
// YOU ARE ALLOWED TO DO SOMETHING LIKE IN
// THIS PSEUDO CODE
const finalReadable = 
  read_stream_1
  .pipe(write_stream_1)
  .pipe(transform_stream_1)
  .pipe(write_stream_2)
  .pipe(transform_stream_2)
  .pipe(final_write_stream)
```

## LETS NOW DO SOME FILE HANDLING WITH STREAMS

WE CAN REMIND OURSELF HOW TO DO THAT

I AM GOING TO SET UP MY NEW FILE TO BE A SHELL SCRIPT (NOTHING SPECIAL, JUST I DON'T WANT TO WRITE `node` WHEN EXECUTING SCRIPT (WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS LIKE THAT, BUT LETS DO IT ANYWAY))

```
touch _exercise_2/foobar.js
```

```js

```
