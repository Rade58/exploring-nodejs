# PROTOCOLS

![ONE](/_IMG/one.png)

## port

SERVICES "SIT" ON THEM, SOME PROTOCOLS CAN HAVE MORE THAN ONE PORT LIKE FTP PROTOCOL

PORT IS A NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 65535 BUT THAT CAN DIFFERENTIATE

# BY DEFAULT SYSTEM CAN ONLY LISTEN TO PORTS BELLOW 1024; SO YOU DON'T USE THOSE

THESE ARE NETCAT COMMANDS

THIS SHOULD BE OK

```
nc -lp 1024
```

BUT IF YOU TRY

```
nc -lp 1023
```

THIAT SHOULD FAIL
