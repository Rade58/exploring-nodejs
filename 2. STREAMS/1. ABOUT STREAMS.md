# WHAT DO I KNOW ABOUT STREAMS

LETS SAY YOU HAVE GOOD "DATA ENTITY"

LETS SAY YOU HAVE TO DO BUNCH OF THING ON THAT "DATA ENTITY"

LETS SAY YOU NEED TO COMPRESS IT, DO SOME TRANSFOMATIONS ON IT, DO SOMETHING ELSE, THEN FILTER SOMETHING OUT, ADD SOMETHING IN

TRADITIONALLY YOU WOULD DO THIS THINGS IN A WAY THAT YOU WOULD INITIATE SOME PROCESS, AND WHEN THAT PROCESS ENDS ANOTHER PROCESS WOULD START, NTILL EVERY PROCESS ONE AFTER ANOTHER IS FINISED

**WITH STREAM YOU CAN DEFINE THAT "ENTITY OF DATA" IS CHUNKED AND YOU RUN ALL PROCESSES, CHUNK by CHUNK**

IT'S LIKE YOU SPLIT THING ON PIECES AND YOU DO ONE THING ON ONE PIECE AND YOU DO IT WELL

THIS IS GOOD WHEN YOU NEED TO PIPE ONE THING TO ANOTHER
