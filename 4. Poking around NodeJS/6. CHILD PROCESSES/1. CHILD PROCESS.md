# CHILD PROCESS

BACK AGAIN AT COMMAND LINE; GOING LOW LEVEL

I'M GOING TO LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITH NODE ACROSS MULTIPLE PROCESS INSTANCES

SPECIFICALLY I WANT TO LEARN HOW TO SPIN OFF CHILD PROCESSES FROM A MAIN NODE PROCESS, AND HOW TO COMMUNICATE BETWEEN PROCESSES

# LETS PREPARE OUR COMMND LINE SCRIPT; THIS TIME WE ARE GOING TO USE `ts-node`

***

**JUST KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE SLOW BECAUSE TRANSPILATION OF TYPESCRIPT CODE**

**+

```
mkdir cp && touch cp/index.ts && code cp/index.ts
```

```js
#!/usr/bin/env ts-node
"use strict"

console.log("Hello world")
```

```
chmod u+x cp/index.ts
```

```
cp/index.ts
```

IT WORKS

# USING BUILT IN MODULE `"child_process"`

ITS BETTER TO START WITH EXAMPLE

OUR FIRST EVER CHILD PROCESS IS GOING TO BE THIS CODE IN THIS FILE

```
touch cp/child1.ts
```

```ts
import {createReadStream, createWriteStream} from 'fs'

const readable = createReadStream("_exercise/server2.js");

const writeable = createWriteStream("cp/hello.js")

readable.pipe(writeable);
```

AS YOU CAN SE WE ARE USING STREAMS ANDD AS A END GAME WE WILL HAVE A CREATION OF NEW FILE (YOU KNOW HOW BECAUSE WE COVERED THE STREAMS EARLIER)

**LETS DEFINE RUNNING OF THIS CHILD PROCESS FROM THE FILE CALLED PARENT**

IT'S A FIE WE ALREADY PREPARED TO BE A COMMAND LINE SCRIPT

```
code cp/index.ts
```

```ts
#!/usr/bin/env ts-node
"use strict"

import childProc from 'child_process'
import {promisify} from 'util'


main()


function main(){
  
  // LETS SPAWN OUR FIRST EVER CHILD PROCESS
  const child = childProc.spawn("ts-node", ["cp/child1.ts"])

  child.on("exit", (code, signal) => {
    // THIS IS GOING TO BE PRINTED WHEN 
    // CHILD PROCESS FINISHES ITS OWN RUN
    console.log({code, signal})
  } )

}

```

**LETS RUN IT**

```
cp/index.ts
```

OUR CHILD PROCESS DID CREATE A NEW FILE IN `cp` FOLDER

## IN PREVIOUS EXAMPLE, INSIDE ON exit HANDLER, WE DID LOGGED A SOMETHING CALLED `EXIT CODE` AND A SIGNAL; BUT LET'S FOCUS ON EXIT CODE

IF CHILD PROCESS FINISHES SUCCESFULLY YOU WILL GET ZERO (0) FOR THE EXIT CODE, AND IF NOT, YOU'LL GET ONE (1)

LETS MESS UP OUR PROGRAM TO SEE 1 INSTEAD OF ZERO

```ts
#!/usr/bin/env ts-node
"use strict"

import childProc from 'child_process'
import {promisify} from 'util'


main()


function main(){
  

  const child = childProc.spawn(
    "ts-node",
    // INSTEAD OF THIS 
    // ["cp/child1.ts"]
    // LETS PUT A PATH OF NON EXISTING FILE
    ["cp,nothing.ts"]
    )

  child.on("exit", (code, signal) => {
    console.log({code, signal})
  } )

}
```

WHEN WE RUN THE PROGRAM

```
cp/index.ts
```

YOU'LL SE THAT PRINTED EXIT CODE IS 1

LETS CHANGE OUR PARENT CODE TO USE RIGHT PATH OF THE CHILD PROCESS AGAIN

```
code cp/index.ts
```

```ts
#!/usr/bin/env ts-node
"use strict"

import childProc from 'child_process'
import {promisify} from 'util'


main()


function main(){
  

  const child = childProc.spawn(
    "ts-node", 
    ["cp/child1.ts"]
  )

  child.on("exit", (code, signal) => {
    console.log({code, signal})
  } )

}

```

# INSIDE CHILD PROCESS, YOU CAN USE `process.exitCode` TO CHANGE THE VALUE OF EXIT CODE

```
code cp/child1.ts
```

```ts
import {createReadStream, createWriteStream} from 'fs'

const readable = createReadStream("_exercise/server2.js");

const writeable = createWriteStream("cp/hello.js")

readable.pipe(writeable);

// HERE YOU GO
process.exitCode = 1
```

WHEN YOU RUN PARENT, YOU SHOULD GET 1 INSIDE ON EXIT HANDLER

```
cp/index.ts
```

YES, EVEN IF CHILED PROCESS RUNNED CORRECTLY, EXIT CODE THAT CAME TO THE PARENT IS 1

# IN POSIX CONVENTION EXIT CODE OF 1 MEANS EROR, AND EXIT CODE OF 0 MEANS EVERYTHING IS FINE

JUST POINTING THAT OUT

# LETS CREATE AN EXAMPLE WITH NETWORK REQUEST INSIDE CHILD PROCESS

**IF REQUEST WAS SUCCESSFULL, WE SHOULD SET ZERO FOR EXIT CODE, IF REQUEST WAS ERROREUS, WE SHOULD SET 1 AS A EXIT CODE**

***

WE NEED ISOMORPHIC FETCH

```
yarn add node-fetch
```

***

***

**WE ARE GOING TO CREATE ANOTHER CHILD PROCESS, THIS ONE IS GOING TO BE JAVASCRIPT SINCE `node-fetch` DOESN'T WORK IF FILE IS EXECUTED AGAINST `ts-node`**

```
touch cp/child2.js
```

``` js
const {createWriteStream} = require('fs')

getRecords()

function getRecords(){

  import("node-fetch").then(async ({default: fetchData}) => {
  
    try {
      
    const { body} = await fetchData("http://localhost:8066/records")

    // TO BE SURE THAT WE GOT THE DATA LETS PIPE 
    //    body  WHIC IS A READABLE STREAM TO SOME FILE

    const writable = createWriteStream("cp/records.json")

    body?.pipe(writable)

    body?.once("end", () => {
      process.exitCode = 0
    })
    
    
    }catch(err){
      
      process.exitCode = 1
    }
  
  })
}

```

***

LETS REDEFINE PARENT PROCESS TO USE THIS NEW CHILD PROCESS


```
code cp/index.ts
```

```js
#!/usr/bin/env ts-node
"use strict"

import childProc from 'child_process'
// import {promisify} from 'util'


main()


function main(){
  

  const child = childProc.spawn(
    // HERE YOU GO
    "node", 
    ["cp/child2.js"]
  )

  child.on("exit", (code, signal) => {
    console.log({code, signal})
  } )

}

```

WE CAN NOW START SERVER THAT SERVES OUR API ROUTE

```
yarn starte
```

IN OTHER TERMINAL INSTANCE, WE CAN RUN PARENT PROCESS

```
cp/index.ts
```

**THIS IS WHAT IS PRINTED IN COMMAND LINE OF THE PARENT PROCESS**

```
{ code: 0, signal: null }
```

**JSON FILE `cp/records.json` IS ALSO CREATED WITH CONTENTS THAT CAME AS DATA FROM HITTING UP MENTIONED API ROUTE**

# WE CAN BE SPAWNING AS MUCH CHILD PROCESSES AS WE WANT

IN PREVIOUS EXAMPLES WE WERE SPAWNING ONLY ONE PROCESS FROM ONE SPECIFIC FILE

**BUT YOU CAN SPAWN AS MUCH PROCESSES AS YOU WANT FROM THAT SPECIFIC FILE; OR YOU CAN USE MULTIPLE FILES** (JUST POINTING THAT OUT: FILE IS NOT A PROCESS IT'S THE EXECUTED CODE FROM THT FILE)

**BUT SINCE JAVASCRIPT IS SINGLE THREADED WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION HOW WE SPAWN IN A LOOP FOR EXAMPLE; BECAUSE IF WE START SPAWNING IN A LOOP OUR THREAD IS GOING TO BE POLUTED WITH SPAWNING, AND ON exit EVEN WILL NEVER FIRE FOR ALL OF THESE PROCESSES, SO WE NEED TO BE SMART OF HOW WE USE PROMISES**

HINT IS THAT WE NEED TO PRIMISIFY ON exit EVENT HANDLER

I WON'T BE DOING ANY EXAMPLES WITH THIS; MAYBE SOMETIMES IN THE FUTURE

# MY ASUMPTION IS THAT I WON'T BE USING CHILD PROCESSES WITH NODEJS ANYWAY

I GUESS THAT PEOPLE AREN'T USING MUCH NODEJS FOR MULTI THREADING THINGS

PEOPLE USE GO, OR SCALA, OR PYTHON FOR THIS KIND OF TASKS; BECAUSE THESE LANGUAGES HAS BETTER SUPPORT FOR THAT I GUESS
