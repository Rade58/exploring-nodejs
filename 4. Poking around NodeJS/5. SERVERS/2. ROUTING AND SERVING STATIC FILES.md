# ROUTING AND SERVING STATIC FILES

I AM GOING TO USE SERVER PACKAGE FOR STATIC FILES

THIS PACKAGE DOESN'T HAVE ANY TYPESCRIPT SUPPORT (JUST POINTING THAT OUT, SO YOU NEED TO READ DOCS)

```
yarn add node-static-alias
```

WE ARE GOING TO CREATE NEW FILE CALLED `file-server.ts`

```
touch web_server/file-server.ts
```

```ts
// @ts-ignore
import {Server} from 'node-static-alias'
import path from 'path'

// THIS PATH IS GOING TO BE THE DOCUMENT ROOTH
// FOR US IT IS       web_server/web_files
// BUT WE NEED ABSOLUTE PATH SO WE ARE USING THIS
const WEB_FILES_PATH = path.resolve(__dirname, "web_files");
// BASICALY WE ARE GOING TO MAKE web_server/web_files
// AND PUT OUR HTML FILES THERE

// console.log({WEB_FILES_PATH})

// THIS PACKAGE BASICALY USES node-static UNDER THE HOOD
// BUT IT HAS SUPPORT FOR ALIASES

// BASICALLY WE WILL HAVE A REGEX MATCHING
// IF USER REQUESTS    /         index.html IS GOING TO BE SERVED
// OFCOURSE WE NEED TO DEFINE THOSE REGEX
// BUT I AM NOT PLANING TO WRITE THEM BY MYSELF
// I'M GOING COPY THEM

// YOU WILL REMEMBER THIS KIND OF SYNTAX
// YOU WERE DOING THIS WHEN SETTING WEB SERVER LIKE NGINX
// OR WHEN WE WERE DEALING WITH KUBERNETES

const createFileServer = () => {

  const fileServer = new Server(WEB_FILES_PATH, {
    cache: 100,
    serverInfo: "Shibatoshi Workshop",
    alias: [
      // THIS IS FOR MAIN PAGE 
      {
        match: /^\/(?:index\/?)?(?:[?#].*$)?$/,
        serve: "index.html",
        // force MEANS THAT index.html NEEDS TO BE MATCHED
        // OR IT NEEDS TO THROW 404
        force: true,
      },
      // I KNOW, REGEX IS QUITE CONFUSING
      // I WOULD NEED SOM TIME TO DECYPHER THIS
      // BUT ON FIRST GLANCE I CAN SEE THAT WE
      // ARE MATCHING JAVASCRIPT FILES
      // ALSO MATCHING ANY OTHER HTML FILE
      // AND LAST ONE IS 404 PAGE
      {
        match: /^\/js\/.+$/,
        serve: "<% absPath %>",
        force: true,
      },
      {
        match: /^\/(?:[\w\d]+)(?:[\/?#].*$)?$/,
        serve: function onMatch(params: any) {
                return `${params.basename}.html`;
        },
      },
      {
        match: /[^]/,
        serve: "404.html",
      }

    ]
  })
  
  return fileServer;

}

export default createFileServer;
```

# WE ARE GOING TO USE THIS FILE SERVER WITH OUR HTTP SERVER IN A WAY THAT WE ARE GOING TO PASS Request AND Response TO THIS SERVER

```
code web_server/index.ts
```

```ts
import {createServer} from 'http'
import type {IncomingMessage, ServerResponse} from 'http'

import initDB from './db'

// WE WILL IMPORT THIS
import createFileServer from './file-server'


const HTTP_PORT = 8066;

// WE CAN CREATE FILE SERVER
const fileServer = createFileServer()


async function initServer() {
  
  const client = await initDB()
  
  const httpServer = createServer(handler)
  
  httpServer.listen(HTTP_PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server on poort ${HTTP_PORT}`)
  })
  
  async function handler(req: IncomingMessage, res: ServerResponse){

    // WE CA PASS REQUEST AND RESPONSE TO FILE SERVER
    fileServer.serve(req,res)

    // LETS RETURN HERE FOR NOW
    return;

    if(req.url === "/hello"){
      res.writeHead(200, {
        "Content-Type": "text/plain"
      })
      res.write("Hello world")
      res.end()
    }else{
      // IF NOT SEND 404
      res.writeHead(404)
      res.end()
    }
   

  }

}

initServer()

```

# NOW WE CAN CREATE FOLDER AND PUT SOME HTML FILES IN IT

```
mkdir web_server/web_files
```

```
touch web_server/web_files/index.html
```

I ADDED HTML CODE; AND PUT SOME HELLO WORLD TEXT INSIDE BODY TAG

LETS NOW START THE SERVERS

```
ts-node web_server/index.ts
```

I WISITED `http://localhost:8066`

AND HTML FILE IS SERVED
