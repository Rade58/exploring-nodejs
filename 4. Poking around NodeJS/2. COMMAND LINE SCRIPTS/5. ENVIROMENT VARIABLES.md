# ENVIROMENT VARIABLES

JUST TO TELL YOU THAT SETTING THEM IS DIFFERENT ON WINDOWS, AND IT IS DIFFERENT ON LINUX

ON LINUX IS MUCH SIMPLER

WE HAVE OUR PROGRAM WHERE WE READ OUR ENVIROMENT VARIABLE

```js
// FILE:      _exercise/shell_scripts/bar.js

const data = process.env.HI

console.log({data})
```

LETS RUN THIS SCRIPT WITH PASSING `HI` ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE

```
HI=hihello node _exercise/shell_scripts/bar.js 
```

THIS IS PRINTED OUT

```
{ data: 'hihello' }
```
