# I WANT TO DEFINE TABLES FOR THE DATBASE OF OUR EXAMPLE; I ALSO WANT TO PUT SOME DATA

WE WILL USE THE CODE FROM THE EXAMPLE WHERE WE WERE DEALING PRIMARY WITH SQLITE

SO THIS IS HOW OUR INITIAL SQL IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE

```
code web_server/mydb.sql
```

```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Shiba (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY ASC,
  bonkId INTEGER,
  info VARCHAR(56),

  FOREIGN KEY (bonkId) REFERENCES Bonk(id)

);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Bonk (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY ASC,
  info VARCHAR(46) UNIQUE
);

```
