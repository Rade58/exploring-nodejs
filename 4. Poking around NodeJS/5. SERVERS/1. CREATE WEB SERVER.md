# CREATING WEB SERVER

WE ARE GOING TO USE TYPESCRIPT FOR THIS EXERCISE, SINCE IS MORE ENJOYABLE TO ME

- `yarn add ts-node-dev`

- `mkdir web_server`

WE ARE GOING TO USE sqlite3 AS OUR DATABASE, SO WE CAN REUSE SOME LOGIC FROM OUR PREVIOUS LECTION

LETS START FROM THERE

## INITIAL DATABASE SETUP

- `touch web_server/db.ts web_server/mydb.sql`

- `code web_server/db.ts`

```ts

```
