# concat-stream

`yarn add concat-stream`

> Writable stream that concatenates all the data from a stream and calls a callback with the result. Use this when you want to collect all the data from a stream into a single buffer.
> Streams emit many buffers. If you want to collect all of the buffers, and when the stream ends concatenate all of the buffers together and receive a single buffer then this is the module for you.
> Only use this if you know you can fit all of the output of your stream into a single Buffer (e.g. in RAM).
