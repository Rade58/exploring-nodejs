# CHILD PROCESS

BACK AGAIN AT COMMAND LINE; GOING LOW LEVEL

I'M GOING TO LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITH NODE ACROSS MULTIPLE PROCESS INSTANCES

SPECIFICALLY I WANT TO LEARN HOW TO SPIN OFF CHILD PROCESSES FROM A MAIN NODE PROCESS, AND HOW TO COMMUNICATE BETWEEN PROCESSES

# LETS PREPARE OUR COMMND LINE SCRIPT; THIS TIME WE ARE GOING TO USE `ts-node`

```
mkdir cp && touch cp/index.ts && code cp/index.ts
```

```js
#!/usr/bin/env ts-node
"use strict"

console.log("Hello world")
```

```
chmod u+x cp/index.ts
```

```
cp/index.ts
```

IT WORKS

# USING BUILT IN MODULE `"child_process"`
