# FILE HANDLING WITH STREAMS

THIS PART ABOUT STREAMS IS GOING TO BE REALLY A RESUME OF WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT STREAMS EARLIER; ALSO I WANT TO INTRODUCE SOME NEW HELPUF RESOURCES

**THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST REESOURCE FOR STREAMS**

[streams handbook by substack](https://github.com/substack/stream-handbook)

## THE THINGS WE DIDN'T NOTICE BEFORE ABOUT READABLE STREAM AND ITS `pipe` METHOD

I DIDN'T NOTICE BFORE THAT **RETURN VALUE** OF THE `readable.pipe()` **IS COMPLETELY A NEW READABLE STREAM** 

```js
const readable2 = readable1.pipe(writable)
```

**THIS IS BECAUSE OF CHAINING OF `pipe` METHODS**

```js
// YOU ARE ALLOWED TO DO SOMETHING LIKE IN
// THIS PSEUDO CODE
const finalReadable = 
  read_stream_1
  .pipe(write_stream_1)
  .pipe(transform_stream_1)
  .pipe(write_stream_2)
  .pipe(transform_stream_2)
  .pipe(final_write_stream)
```

## LETS NOW DO SOME FILE HANDLING WITH STREAMS

WE CAN REMIND OURSELF HOW TO DO THAT

I AM GOING TO SET UP MY NEW FILE TO BE A SHELL SCRIPT (NOTHING SPECIAL, JUST I DON'T WANT TO WRITE `node` WHEN EXECUTING SCRIPT (WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS LIKE THAT, BUT LETS DO IT ANYWAY))

```
touch _exercise_2/foobar.js
```

```
chmod u+x _exercise_2/foobar.js
```

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
"use strict"

const {createReadStream} = require("fs")
const path = require("path")


const minimist = require("minimist");


const args = minimist(process.argv.slice(2), {
  boolean: ["help"],
  string: ["file"]
})


if(args["help"]){
  return printHelp()
}

if(!args["file"]){
  return printError("You must provide file path", true)
}


  // WE CAN HERE TRY READING FROM A FILE

const filePath = path.resolve(args["file"])


const neuReadStream = createReadStream(filePath)


// WE CAN HANDLE EROR HERE
neuReadStream.on("error", (err) => {

  printError(err.message)
})


// WE CAN PIPE TO THE STANDARD OUT
neuReadStream.pipe(process.stdout);


// *****************************************

function printHelp(){
  console.log(`
          foobar --help

  --help          getting help
  --file          specify file path (string)
  `)
}

function printError(msg, includeHelp = false){

  console.error(msg)

  if(includeHelp){
    printHelp()
  }
}
```

WE CAN TEST IT NOW

```
_exercise_2/foobar.js --file _exercise/someFile1.txt
```
