# SQLite3

[LETS INSTALL IT](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-sqlite-on-ubuntu-20-04)

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install sqlite3
```

VERIFY INSTALL

```
sqlite3 --version
```

DATBASE IS GOING TO BE IN FAT BINARY FILE FORMAT, LOCALLY WHERE WE ARE WORKING (IT IS CONVINIENT FOR DEMO PURPOSES, **BUT THIS DATBASE HAS PRODUCTION QUALITIES AND IT IS USED IN A LOT OF PLACES**)

I SAW THAT WEB BROWSERS HAVE SQLite BUILT INT OTHEM

I AM ALSO GOING TO USE NODE PACKAGE CALLED `sqlite3`

```
yarn add sqlite3
```

```
yarn add @types/sqlite3 --dev
```
